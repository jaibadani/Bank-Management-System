# CiaoBank Management System

**Team Name:** Boom Boom Ciao
**Project Title:** CiaoBank Management System
**Author:** Jai Badani & Team

Project Description:
This is a banking simulation project built using Python. It allows users to perform standard banking operations like creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing cash, and transferring funds to other users.

The project also includes an Admin panel to manage loans and a Support panel to handle user complaints. We have integrated a real database to store records and an email system to send OTPs and transaction alerts.

Concepts & Libraries Used:

**Concepts:**
1) **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The main logic is built using a Bank class.
2) **Database Management:** We used SQL to store user data permanently.
3) **Modular Programming:** The code is divided into different files for better organization.
4) **Exception Handling:** Used to handle errors and keep the program running.

**Libraries:**
- `sqlite3`: For the database connection.
- `smtplib`: For sending emails (OTPs and alerts).
- `random`: To generate random account numbers and PINs.
- `datetime`: To record the exact time of transactions.
- `winsound`: For simple sound effects.

Main Modules and Functions:

**1. new_account()**
This function registers a new user. It asks for personal details, verifies the email with an OTP, and generates a unique account number.
**Input:** Name: Jai, Email: jai@test.com, Phone: 9876543210.
**Output:** "Account Created. Your Account Number is 543210."

**2. transfer()**
This handles sending money from one user to another. It checks if the sender has enough balance and if the receiver exists.
**Input:** Target Account: 123456, Amount: 500.
**Output:** "Transfer Successful. Email sent to receiver."

**3. admin_loans()**
This function allows the Admin to view pending loan requests and approve or decline them.
**Input:** Loan ID: 2, Action: Approve.
**Output:** "Loan Approved. Amount credited to user."

**4. helpdesk()**
Allows users to raise a complaint ticket. The support team can later view this and reply.
**Input:** Query: "My transaction failed."
**Output:** "Ticket created. We will get back to you."

Setup Instructions:

1.  Download the project folder.
2.  Open `config.py` and enter your sender email and password (needed for sending emails).
3.  To run the project, open the terminal in the project folder and type:
    ```
    python run.py
    ```
4.  The database `bank.db` will be created automatically when you run it for the first time.
